	New library file: NEW_LIB_FILE.lib was created.

The final percent deviation between the gaff_02/mon.lib 
and gaff_02/resp.out charge sets is 7.91%

	Nice! Now you could move on to the bonded parameter derivation process

The vacuum charges from the gaff_02/resp.out file must be used for bonded parameter derivation.
