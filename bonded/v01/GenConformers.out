(1.) Energies of the initial and final states.  Units are kcal/mol.  A number 
     of statistics could be of interest here: this table tries to anticipate 
     them.

 Statistic                Mean Value    Std. Dev.   Min. Value   Max. Value  
                           (kcal/mol)   (kcal/mol)   (kcal/mol)   (kcal/mol) 
 ------------------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------

 Initial E(Restraint) (b)     139.4843      67.7197       0.0478     314.0915
 Final E(Model) (c)          -128.5975      13.2341    -144.0410     -50.2289
 Final E(Restraint) (d)         1.3445       4.7568       0.0006      47.1595

  (a) The energies of the initial models, without the restraint energy (this 
      is an indicator of how strained the configurations were before mdgx 
      began to manipulate them).
  (b) When restraints were first applied to the initial models, these were the 
      restraint energies.
  (c) The energies of the final models, again excluding restraint energy. 
      This is an indicator of how strained the molecular configurations became 
      after manipulation.
  (d) Restraint energy needed to get the final configurations into place.
  (e) This is an indicator of the change in molecular mechanics energy. 
      E(model) will typically rise, indicating that structures became 
      distorted in response to pressure from external restraints.
  (f) The change in restraint energy.  E(restraint) will typically fall as 
      restraints force the structures into new configurations.

(2.) Convergence statistics for the run.  The first block of information 
     describes the energy minimization of ALL configurations, regardless of 
     whether they were printed.  Next, counts of configurations passing the 
     basic sanity checks are presented.  Configurations failing any one sanity 
     check are not printed.

 - Average steps to convergence:     719 +/-  200
 - Total converged configurations:   870
 - Unconverged configurations:       130

 - Average of the maximal residual force
   on NON-converged configurations:        1.842116e-01 kcal/mol-A
 - Average residual forces on frequently strained atoms:
     Atom    6, C3   (21 configs):         2.257751e-01 kcal/mol-A
     Atom    7, C4   (21 configs):         1.102033e-03 kcal/mol-A
     Atom    4, C2   (17 configs):         8.702563e-04 kcal/mol-A
     Atom   17, C11  ( 8 configs):         3.695653e-04 kcal/mol-A
     Atom    9, N    ( 7 configs):         1.685195e-05 kcal/mol-A

(3.) Basic sanity checks.  If a configuration fails these tests, it was not 
     printed out for further consideration but the reasons it failed will be 
     summarized here.  The tests are that, first, no bond of a configuration 
     may be strained more than 10.00 kcal/mol.  Furthermore, no angle may be 
     strained more than 10.00 kcal/mol.  Finally, the maximum tolerated 
     restraint energy (summed over all restraints) is 200.00 kcal/mol. If any 
     of these tests seem too stringent or not tight enough, the thresholds may 
     be changed in the &configs namelist.

 - Configurations passing all sanity checks:        971
 - Configurations failing bond sanity check:          0
 - Configurations failing angle sanity check:        29
 - Configurations failing restraint sanity check:     0
